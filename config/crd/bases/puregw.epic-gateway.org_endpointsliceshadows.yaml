        description: "EndpointSliceShadow is a kludge because of a difference in the
          way that EndpointSlice works compared to basically every other k8s object.
          When you scale a service down to zero endpoints the EndpointSlice controller
          BLOWS AWAY THE SLICE ANNOTATIONS AND FINALIZERS. This is incredibly hostile,
          but when I opened an issue the devs doubled down and indicated that this
          was as intended. \n Since we can't mark the EndpointSlice in the usual way
          we have this \"shadow\" resource that holds the extra data that we need."

                        can be interpreted differently based on the type of parent
                        resource. \n When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets
                        all listeners listening on the specified port that also support
                        this kind of Route(and select this Route). It's not recommended
                        to set `Port` unless the networking behaviors specified in
                        a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s)
                        whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener

                        Port is interpreted. \n For the purpose of status, an attachment
                        is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts
                        it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict
                        which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace,
                        or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this
                        Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
