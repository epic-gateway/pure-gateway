          EndpointSliceShadow is a kludge because of a difference in the way
          that EndpointSlice works compared to basically every other k8s
          object. When you scale a service down to zero endpoints the
          EndpointSlice controller BLOWS AWAY THE SLICE ANNOTATIONS AND
          FINALIZERS. This is incredibly hostile, but when I opened an issue
          the devs doubled down and indicated that this was as intended.


          Since we can't mark the EndpointSlice in the usual way we have this
          "shadow" resource that holds the extra data that we need.

                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                    with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                        to the local namespace of the Route.


                        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.


                        <gateway:experimental:description>
                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                        routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                        any namespace to the Service.


                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                        "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                        connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                        the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                        ParentRef of the Route.

                        Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                        differently based on the type of parent resource.


                        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                        listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                        select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                        must match both specified values.


                        <gateway:experimental:description>
                        When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                        Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                        the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.
                        </gateway:experimental:description>


                        Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                        Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                        document how/if Port is interpreted.


                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                        * Gateway: Listener Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                        both specified values.
                        * Service: Port Name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                        both specified values. Note that attaching Routes to Services as Parents
                        is part of experimental Mesh support and is not supported for any other
                        purpose.


                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                        interpreted.


                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
